Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values in the dataset by removing rows with missing data.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to ensure they are on a similar scale using Min-Max Scaling.
Feature Selection: Use the chi-squared test to select the most relevant features for disease prediction.
Model Development
Logistic Regression: A linear classification model used for predicting binary outcomes.
Decision Tree: A non-linear classification model that makes decisions based on feature values.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Validation and Testing
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Cross-Validation: Assess model performance using k-fold cross-validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune model hyperparameters using grid search with cross-validation.
